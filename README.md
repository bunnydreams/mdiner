# The MDiner

A simple web app built with Express.js that searches for food that the user desires from [MDining](https://dining.umich.edu/) dining halls within a specified date range.

The app works by getting data from the UMich Student Life API, and storing the food data in a remote MongoDB server for quick retrieval.

## Usage

- Go to the [MDiner](https://mdiner.now.sh)
- Type in what you would like to eat
- Select a date range (or use the default range)
- Click âœ… and I hope you find what you're looking for!

## Installation

To run the web app locally

- Install the following dependencies
  - Install Node.js
  - Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install Express.js and other dependencies
- Run the app by running `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
